# Proxy Server System

## Introduction

This project implements a Proxy Server system using Python. A proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients and the internet, intercepting requests, forwarding them to the main server, and caching responses to improve performance.

## Project Objective

Design and implement a proxy server that efficiently handles client requests, caches responses, and facilitates seamless communication with main servers.

## Project Components

1. **Client Code:**
   - Establishes a connection with the proxy server.
   - Sends HTTP requests for resources.
   - Uses the `socket` library for network communication and `tkinter` for a GUI to input URLs.

2. **Main Server Code:**
   - Represents the server fulfilling requests from the proxy server.
   - Handles incoming connections, processes requests, and responds with web content.

3. **Proxy Server Code:**
   - Acts as an intermediary between client and main server.
   - Intercepts, forwards requests, caches responses, and returns content to the client.
   - Utilizes threading for concurrent handling and caching for frequently accessed content.

## Functionality

- **Client Interaction:**
  - Users input URLs through a GUI.
  - Sends HTTP requests to the proxy server to fetch web content.

- **Proxy Server Operation:**
  - Listens for incoming client connections.
  - Fetches content from the main server or serves cached responses.
  - Maintains a cache to optimize performance.

- **Main Server Communication:**
  - Forwards client requests to the main server.
  - Relays responses back to clients after caching.

## Conclusion

This proxy server system enhances web resource retrieval and caching, leveraging Pythonâ€™s socket programming and GUI libraries to improve network performance and optimize resource utilization.
